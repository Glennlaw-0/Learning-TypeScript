# Learning TypeScript

## What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the worldâ€™s most used tools, by adding static type definitions. Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly. Writing types can be optional in TypeScript, because type inference allows you to get a lot of power without writing additional code.

### Tech

Learning TypeScript uses a number of tools to work properly:

- [TypeScript] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [VS Code] - An IDE for development
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd Learning-TypeScript
$ npm install -d
$ code . (For VSCode)
```
