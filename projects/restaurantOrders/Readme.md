# Restaurant Orders

Let’s come back to the restaurant recommender. The restaurant managers gave feedback that they were looking for additional functionality to filter orders so they can highlight their specials on the app.

We’re going to build on top of the previous project to filter orders instead of restaurants. The restaurant managers want to surface dishes that fit within the customer’s budget and show the cost of each dish. The program will use array methods, functions, and practice good code hygiene and organization. Let’s work on it step by step and enjoy some chicken and waffles at the end!

Your finished program will filter orders by price and print out the orders and their prices like below:

Restaurant Name #1

- Order 1: $9.99
- Order 2: $8.99
  Restaurant Name #2
- Order 1: $17.99
- Order 2: $15.99
  Throughout the project, you may find it helpful to validate your progress. There are tasks at the end of each group to walk you through this, however, here are a couple of commands that may be useful as you work:

To verify your code with the typescript compiler: tsc

To run your code after you’ve compiled: node index.js
